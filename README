My final paper is NBAShotOutcomePrediction.pdf
The run_me_clust.py file contains code for all of my experiments. To save time I created pickle files for all of my results so I could create exhibits. 
My plotting code is in clustPlotting.py
I created a large codebase to clean my data in different ways, so I only am including the cleaning code for the Clustered feature representation because that is what most of my paper is referencing. The README file in this folder contains more information.
Sample Data Files folder contains examples of single games of play-by-play logs, rookie player features, player cluster tables, player performance statistics, and the final processing of a single game. the README file in that folder contains more information.
