# NBAShotPrediction
NBA play by play data and player statistics are used to predict individual shot outcomes. Pandas is used to combine and clean the data. Scikit-Learn is used for modeling.  


Play-by-play data from the 2009-2010 NBA regular season is analyzed in an attempt to classify which shots are made or missed. A sparse feature representation where each player on offense, defense, or shooting is given their own indicator variable is compared against a representation using k means clustering to group each player into one of five clusters based on their previous seasonâ€™s statistics. A degree- 2 polynomial basis expansion is performed followed by Principle Component Analysis and i)Bernoulli Naive Bayes, ii)Stochastic Gradient Descent with a variety of loss functions and iii) Random Forest classifiers are implemented and compared for accuracy. A train validation test split is used for hyperparameter optimization ensuring that no future data is used in training. A Random Forest classifier with 40 estimators and a max tree depth of 10 is found to achieve the highest test accuracy observed at 59.44%.
